# readlineSync

Synchronous [Readline](http://nodejs.org/api/readline.html) for interactively running.  
The interface is used with `process.stdin` and `process.stdout` in order to accept user input.

## Example

```js
var readlineSync = require('readline-sync');
var userName = readlineSync.question('May I have your name? :'); // Wait for user's response.
var favFood = readlineSync.question('Hi ' + userName + '! What is your favorite food? :');
console.log('Oh, ' + userName + ' likes ' + favFood + '!');
```

```shell
May I have your name? :AnSeki
Hi AnSeki! What is your favorite food? :chocolate
Oh, AnSeki likes chocolate!
```

## Installation

```
npm install readline-sync
```

## Methods

### question

```js
line = readlineSync.question([query[, options]])
```

Displays the `query` to the user, and then returns the user's response after it has been typed.  
You can specify `options`. (see [Options](#options))

The `query` may be string, or may not be (e.g. number, Date, Object, etc.). This is converted to string (i.e. `toString` method is called) before it is displayed every time.

### prompt

```js
line = readlineSync.prompt([options])
```

Displays the current prompt (See `setPrompt` method) to the user, and then returns the user's response after it has been typed.  
You can specify `options`. (see [Options](#options))

### setPrompt

```js
currentPrompt = readlineSync.setPrompt([prompt])
```

Sets the prompt, for example when you run `node` on the command line, you see `> `, which is node's prompt. (See `prompt` method)

The `prompt` may be string, or may not be (e.g. number, Date, Object, etc.). This is converted to string (i.e. `toString` method is called) before it is displayed every time.  
For example, `[foo-directory]#` like a bash shell that show the current directory.

```js
// Object that has toString method.
readlineSync.setPrompt({
  toString: function() {
    return '[' + require('path').basename(process.cwd()) + ']# '; // Get and show current directory.
  }
})
```

### setEncoding

```js
currentEncoding = readlineSync.setEncoding([encoding])
```

Set the encoding method of input (user's response) and output (`prompt` method and `question` method). Defaults to 'utf8'.

### setPrint

```js
readlineSync.setPrint([funcPrint])
```

The specified `funcPrint` Function is called when any outputs (`prompt` method and `question` method). Defaults to `undefined`.  
The `funcPrint` is given two arguments the output text and `encoding`.

![sample](cl_01.png)

For example, this is used to pass plain texts to the Logger, when texts are colored.

```js
var readlineSync = require('readline-sync'),
  user, pw, cmd;
require('colors');

readlineSync.setPrint(function(display, encoding) {
  logger.log(display.stripColors); // Remove control characters.
});

console.log('Your account required.'.grey);
user = readlineSync.question('USER NAME'.white.inverse + ': ');
pw = readlineSync.question('PASSWORD'.white.inverse + ': ', {noEchoBack: true});
// Authorization ...
console.log(('Welcome, ' + user + '!').green.bold);

readlineSync.setPrompt('> '.bold.red);
cmd = readlineSync.prompt();
```

## Options

An `options` Object can be specified to `prompt` method and `question` method. This Object can have following properties.

### noEchoBack

Type: Boolean  
Default: `false`

If `true` is specified, echo back is avoided. It is used to hide the secret text (e.g. password) which is typed by user on screen.  
For example:

```js
password = readlineSync.question('PASSWORD :', {noEchoBack: true});
console.log('Login ...');
```

The typed text is not shown on screen.

```shell
PASSWORD :
Login ...
```

### noTrim

Type: Boolean  
Default: `false`

By default, the leading and trailing white spaces are removed from typed text. If `true` is specified, those are not removed.

## With Task Runner

The easy way to control the flow of task runner by the user's response:
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) plugin: [grunt-confirm](https://github.com/anseki/grunt-confirm)
* [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) plugin: [gulp-confirm](https://github.com/anseki/gulp-confirm)

If you want to control the flow of task runner (e.g. [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)), call readlineSync in a task callback that is called by task runner. Then the flow of tasks is paused and it is controlled by user.

Example: by using [grunt-task-helper](https://github.com/anseki/grunt-task-helper)

```shell
$ grunt
Running "fileCopy" task
Files already exist:
  file-a.png
  file-b.js
Overwrite? (y/n) :y
file-a.png copied.
file-b.js copied.
Done.
```

`Gruntfile.js`

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  taskHelper: {
    fileCopy: {
      options: {
        handlerByTask: function() {
          // Abort the task if user don't want.
          return readlineSync.question('Overwrite? (y/n) :')
            .toLowerCase() === 'y';
          // Or process.exit()
        },
        filesArray: []
      },
      ...
    }
  },
  copy: {
    fileCopy: {
      files: '<%= taskHelper.fileCopy.options.filesArray %>'
    }
  }
});
```

## Note

### Platforms

The your Node and OS may not support interactively reading from stdin. The stdin interfaces are different by platforms.  
If in those platforms, an error is thrown.

```js
try {
  answer = readlineSync.question('What is your favorite food? :');
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e);
  process.exit(1);
}
```

### Reading by shell

readlineSync tries reading from stdin by shell if it is needed. And, it use "piping via files" for synchronous running.  
As everyone knows, "piping via files" is no good. It blocks event loop and a process. It may make your script be slow.

Why did I choose it? :

+ The best solution is [child_process.execSync](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/doc/api/child_process.markdown#child_processexecsynccommand-options) in core modules of Node. But it is not supported by current version.
+ The good modules (native addon) for synchronous execution exist. But node-gyp can't compile those in some platforms or Node versions.
+ I think that the security is important more than the speed. Some modules have problem about security. (Those don't protect data.) I think that the speed is not needed usually, because readlineSync is used while user types keys.

Someday, I may rewrite readlineSync to use child_process.execSync, or safety module.
